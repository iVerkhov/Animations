**CHALLENGE:**

Go back to the Guess the Flag project and add some animation:

1. _When you tap a flag, make it spin around 360 degrees on the Y axis._
1. _Make the other two buttons fade out to 25% opacity._
1. _Add a third effect of your choosing to the two flags the user didn’t choose – maybe make them scale down? Or flip in a different direction? Experiment!_
